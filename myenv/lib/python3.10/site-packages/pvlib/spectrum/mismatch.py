def get_example_spectral_response(wavelength=None):
    '''
    Generate a generic smooth spectral response (SR) for tests and experiments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wavelength: 1-D sequence of numeric, optional
        Wavelengths at which spectral response values are generated.
        By default ``wavelength`` is from 280 to 1200 in 5 nm intervals. [nm]

    Returns
    -------
    spectral_response : pandas.Series
        The relative spectral response indexed by ``wavelength`` in nm. [-]

    Notes
    -----
    This spectral response is based on measurements taken on a c-Si cell.
    A small number of points near the measured curve are used to define
    a cubic spline having no undue oscillations, as shown in [1]_.  The spline
    can be interpolated at arbitrary wavelengths to produce a continuous,
    smooth curve , which makes it suitable for experimenting with spectral
    data of different resolutions.

def get_am15g(wavelength=None):
    '''
    Read the ASTM G173-03 AM1.5 global spectrum on a 37-degree tilted surface,
    optionally interpolated to the specified wavelength(s).

    Global (tilted) irradiance includes direct and diffuse irradiance from sky
    and ground reflections, and is more formally called hemispherical
    irradiance (on a tilted surface).  In the context of photovoltaic systems
    the irradiance on a flat receiver is frequently called plane-of-array (POA)
    irradiance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wavelength: 1-D sequence of numeric, optional
        Wavelengths at which the spectrum is interpolated.
        By default the 2002 wavelengths of the standard are returned. [nm]

    Returns
    -------
    am15g: pandas.Series
        The AM1.5g standard spectrum indexed by ``wavelength``. [(W/m^2)/nm]

    Notes
    -----
    If ``wavelength`` is specified this function uses linear interpolation.

    If the values in ``wavelength`` are too widely spaced, the integral of the
    spectrum may deviate from the standard value of 1000.37 W/m^2.

    The values in the data file provided with pvlib-python are copied from an
    Excel file distributed by NREL, which is found here:

def calc_spectral_mismatch_field(sr, e_sun, e_ref=None):
    """
    Calculate spectral mismatch between a test device and broadband reference
    device under specified solar spectral irradiance conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sr: pandas.Series
        The relative spectral response of one (photovoltaic) test device.
        The index of the Series must contain wavelength values in nm. [-]

    e_sun: pandas.DataFrame or pandas.Series
        One or more measured solar irradiance spectra in a pandas.DataFrame
        having wavelength in nm as column index.  A single spectrum may be
        be given as a pandas.Series having wavelength in nm as index.
        [(W/m^2)/nm]

    e_ref: pandas.Series, optional
        The reference spectrum to use for the mismatch calculation.
        The index of the Series must contain wavelength values in nm.
        The default is the ASTM G173-03 global tilted spectrum. [(W/m^2)/nm]

    Returns
    -------
    smm: pandas.Series or float if a single measured spectrum is provided. [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Measured solar spectral irradiance usually covers a wavelength range
    that is smaller than the range considered as broadband irradiance.
    The infrared limit for the former typically lies around 1100 or 1600 nm,
    whereas the latter extends to around 2800 or 4000 nm.  To avoid imbalance
    between the magnitudes of the integrated spectra (the broadband values)
    this function truncates the reference spectrum to the same range as the
    measured (or simulated) field spectra. The assumption implicit in this
    truncation is that the energy in the unmeasured wavelength range
    is the same fraction of the broadband energy for both the measured
    spectra and the reference spectrum.

    If the default reference spectrum is used it is linearly interpolated
    to the wavelengths of the measured spectrum, but if a reference spectrum
    is provided via the parameter ``e_ref`` it is used without change. This
    makes it possible to avoid interpolation, or to use a different method of
    interpolation, or to avoid truncation.

    The spectral response is linearly interpolated to the wavelengths of each
    spectrum with which is it multiplied internally (``e_sun`` and ``e_ref``).
    If the wavelengths of the spectral response already match one or both
    of these spectra interpolation has no effect; therefore, another type of
    interpolation could be used to process ``sr`` before calling this function.

    The standards describing mismatch calculations focus on indoor laboratory
    applications, but are applicable to outdoor performance as well.
    The 2016 version of ASTM E973 [1]_ is somewhat more difficult to
    read than the 2010 version [2]_ because it includes adjustments for
    the temperature dependency of spectral response, which led to a
    formulation using quantum efficiency (QE).
    IEC 60904-7 is clearer and also discusses the use of a broadband
    reference device. [3]_
