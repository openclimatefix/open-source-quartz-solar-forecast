# Pickling of pyarrow arrays is effectively broken - pickling a slice of an
# array ends up pickling the entire backing array.
#
# See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARROW-10739
#
# This comes up when using pandas `string[pyarrow]` dtypes, which are backed by
# a `pyarrow.StringArray`.  To fix this, we register a *global* override for
# pickling `ArrowStringArray` or `ArrowExtensionArray` types (where available).
# We do this at the pandas level rather than the pyarrow level for efficiency reasons
# (a pandas ArrowStringArray may contain many small pyarrow StringArray objects).
#
# The implementation here is based on https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/49078
# which is included in pandas=2+. We can remove all this once Dask's minimum
# supported pandas version is at least 2.0.0.
